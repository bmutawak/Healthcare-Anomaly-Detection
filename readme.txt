How to use software:

1. Create a python environment with the packages included in "requirements.txt".
2. In the supplied code, at the bottom of ae_main.py:
	- Modify the parameters: num_train, percTest, embeddingDim to reflect certain areas in the paper.
	- Run the code. This will train a AE on the selected dataset and parameters and then infer and produce ROC curves. Or, you can use the supplied model files and comment out the training line.
